> [!WARNING]
> This repository is for historical purposes only. It is used as a monument to the year 2022, and may be used as a "nostalgia kit" to run older SalernOS versions from that year. The SalernOS Emulation Environment was discontinued in 2023 and is no longer in use. The [SalernOS repository](https://github.com/Alessandro-Salerno/SalernOS) now holds all the necessary files to build, test, and run SalernOS.

## SalernOS
SalernOS is a small Toy OS I'm working on.

## SalernOS Emulation Environment
This repository will help you run SalernOS in an emulator such as QEMU.

## Usage
Open a terminal in this directory, and type `make`. Make sure to have a `SalernOS.img` file here.
